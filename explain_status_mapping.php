echo "UNDERSTANDING STATUS MAPPING EXPLANATION\n";
echo str_repeat("=", 50) . "\n\n";

echo "WHAT DOES 'mapped to Active status' MEAN?\n";
echo str_repeat("-", 45) . "\n\n";

echo "1. ORIGINAL PROBLEM:\n";
echo "   ❌ Database has orders with status = 'pending'\n";
echo "   ❌ Frontend expects status = 'Active' to show in Active tab\n";
echo "   ❌ Result: New orders were invisible!\n\n";

echo "2. THE MAPPING SOLUTION:\n";
echo "   🔧 We modified CheckoutController to translate statuses\n";
echo "   🔄 'pending' (database) → 'Active' (frontend display)\n";
echo "   ✅ Result: Orders now appear in Active tab!\n\n";

echo "3. TECHNICAL DETAILS:\n";
echo "   📍 Location: CheckoutController::index() method\n";
echo "   🛠️ Code snippet:\n";
echo "       \$statusMapping = [\n";
echo "           'pending' => 'Active',\n";
echo "           'in_progress' => 'Active',\n";
echo "           'active' => 'Active',\n";
echo "           'completed' => 'Completed',\n";
echo "           'cancelled' => 'Cancelled'\n";
echo "       ];\n\n";

echo "4. CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:\n";
echo str_repeat("-", 45) . "\n";

// Get the actual data to demonstrate
$sellerId = 3;
$pendingOrders = DB::table('manage_orders')
    ->where('user_id', $sellerId)
    ->where('status', 'pending')
    ->get(['id', 'buyer', 'gig', 'status', 'created_at']);

echo "   📊 Database Reality:\n";
foreach($pendingOrders as $order) {
    echo "   - Order {$order->id}: status = '{$order->status}' (in database)\n";
}

echo "\n   🖥️ Frontend Display:\n";
foreach($pendingOrders as $order) {
    echo "   - Order {$order->id}: status = 'Active' (shown to user)\n";
}

echo "\n5. WHY IS THIS NECESSARY?\n";
echo str_repeat("-", 45) . "\n";
echo "   🎯 Frontend Component Design:\n";
echo "   - YourActiveContracts.vue has tabs: Active, Completed, etc.\n";
echo "   - Each tab filters orders by specific status names\n";
echo "   - 'Active' tab looks for status = 'Active'\n";
echo "   - But new orders are created with status = 'pending'\n\n";

echo "   💡 Business Logic:\n";
echo "   - 'Pending' orders ARE active work that needs attention\n";
echo "   - Sellers should see them in the 'Active' tab\n";
echo "   - So we map 'pending' → 'Active' for display purposes\n\n";

echo "6. FLOW DIAGRAM:\n";
echo str_repeat("-", 45) . "\n";
echo "   Buyer Places Order\n";
echo "          ↓\n";
echo "   Database: status = 'pending'\n";
echo "          ↓\n";
echo "   CheckoutController processes request\n";
echo "          ↓\n";
echo "   Status Mapping: 'pending' → 'Active'\n";
echo "          ↓\n";
echo "   Frontend receives: status = 'Active'\n";
echo "          ↓\n";
echo "   Order appears in 'Active' tab\n\n";

echo "7. BEFORE vs AFTER FIX:\n";
echo str_repeat("-", 45) . "\n";
echo "   BEFORE (Broken):\n";
echo "   - Database: 'pending'\n";
echo "   - Frontend expects: 'Active'\n";
echo "   - Result: Orders not shown ❌\n\n";
echo "   AFTER (Fixed):\n";
echo "   - Database: 'pending'\n";
echo "   - Mapped to: 'Active'\n";
echo "   - Result: Orders visible in Active tab ✅\n\n";

echo "📋 SUMMARY:\n";
echo str_repeat("=", 50) . "\n";
echo "\"6 pending orders (mapped to 'Active' status)\" means:\n\n";
echo "✓ There are 6 orders in the database with status = 'pending'\n";
echo "✓ Our code automatically translates 'pending' to 'Active'\n";
echo "✓ Users see these 6 orders in the 'Active' tab\n";
echo "✓ The mapping happens in real-time during data retrieval\n";
echo "✓ Database stays unchanged - only display is modified\n\n";

echo "🎯 RESULT: New orders are now visible where they should be!\n";
